              For the past seven years I have worked in Planning/Supply Chain for an aerospace manufacturing company. While I have grown a lot during this time, both professionally and personally, I have decided I do not identify with this world any longer. After much soul-searching, speaking to loved ones, and career coaching - I have decided to pursue a career change. In January of 2021 I enrolled in Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. My goal is to complete this course, develop programming and teamwork skills, and ultimately put myself on a path to become a back-end software engineer in 2022.  The intention of this page is to keep everyone up to date on my recent projects. Please feel free to share with anyone that may be interested in my work!
